PhD Thesis
======
* Dissertation Title - Minority and Majority: Cleavages, Conflicts, and Electoral Politics in the Indian Sub-Continent
* Chair - Paul F. Diehl | Committee - Jennifer Holmes, Meghna Sabharwal, and Vito
D’Orazio
* Description - This dissertation examines the aspects of ethnic conflict not only through
the lens of the minorities, but studies the apprehension and threat perspective of the
majority as well. Using social constructivist and horizontal inequality theories, the first
part of the dissertation analyzes the impact of multiple, simultaneous cleavages rather
than only one in isolation. Theoretical arguments are tested over 60 ethnic groups of the
Indian Sub-Continent over 1947 – 2013. The second part of the doctoral research examines
ethnic tensions from the majority’s point of view through the lens of security dilemma
among the Hindus against Muslims over past four electoral cycles in India. Thereafter the
research analyzes the politicization process of the threat perspective by right-wing for
electoral benefits.
