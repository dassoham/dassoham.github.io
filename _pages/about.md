<div style="text-align: justify">
I am a Research Scientist of Political Science at the University of Texas at Dallas. After finishing my
studies in International Relations at Jadavpur University in India, I decided to further my education,
and applied to The University of Texas – Dallas’ Political Science doctoral program in 2015. In
addition to receiving PhD in Political Science in 2020 with a concentration in Research Methods, I
simultaneously earned a Master of Arts in Political Science in 2017. My scholarly interests are at the
intersection of sustainable development, ethnopolitics, civil conflict, social science data analysis, and
electoral politics. This includes the causes of militarized conflict, peacekeeping, public policymaking,
and majoritarian electoral dynamics of North America and South Asia. To perform such analytics
effectively and accurately, I am proficient in using tools like Stata, Tableau, and Excel, and possess
intermediate skills in Power BI and R.
<br/><br/>
My research uses mixed-method research approaches and one of the projects on multifaceted
deprivation and conflict was published in the Journal of South Asian Security and International
Affairs (Vol 6, No 3). I am currently working as a researcher for a Harvard University and UT Dallas
joint project under the DARPA Data Driven Discovery of Models (D3M) program.
